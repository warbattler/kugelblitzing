# Kugelblitzing - Scripts
A classic array of Linux scripts.
There are 3 classes when it comes to Kugelblitzin' around here.
Kugelblitzing Essentials (Just the essentials for lazy Linux users who just want stuff done quick in an array.)
Kugelblitzing Classic (Somewhat complex scripts, e.g, DHCP client pinging to get a new IP, etc.)
Kugelblitzing Advanced (Absolute ironclad. I will use my maximum proficiency of scripting to reach this level.)
